 ### Title: HealthBoost
 
A Personalized Nutrition and Workout App for Improved Health and Wellness.

### Introduction:

The need for personalized nutrition and workout plans has become increasingly important in today's society as people are becoming more health-conscious. Health-Boost is a cutting-edge web and mobile application that provides personalized nutrition and workout plans to individuals looking to improve their health and wellness. The purpose of this interim report is to present an update on the progress of the development of the Health-Boost app. This report will provide an overview of the big picture, motivation behind the app, and key technologies used in its development.

### Big Picture:

The big picture of the Health-Boost app is to provide a comprehensive wellness solution for individuals and businesses. The app aims to offer personalized and optimized plans based on the individual's dietary restrictions, health goals, fitness level, and personal preferences. Health-Boost offers a unique and innovative solution for users to improve their health and wellness through customized nutrition and workout plans.

### Motivation:

The motivation behind developing the Health-Boost app is to address the growing need for personalized nutrition and workout plans. The app aims to provide users with a comprehensive wellness solution that meets their specific needs and preferences. The app's personalized nutrition and workout plans are based on the user's dietary restrictions, health goals, and fitness level, making it easier for users to achieve their health and wellness goals.

### Key Technologies:

The Health-Boost app is being developed using several key technologies, including React Native for the front end and Node.js for the back end. React Native is a popular open-source framework that allows for the development of mobile and web applications using a single codebase. Node.js is a popular backend technology that provides a scalable and efficient way to build web applications. The database for the app is powered by SQL, a popular relational database management system. RESTful API is used to communicate between the frontend and backend, ensuring secure and efficient data transfer.

 ### Detailed Key Technologies (How/Why used):
 
React Native: React Native is a JavaScript framework for building mobile applications that allow for efficient development and deployment of cross-platform apps. We are using React Native to develop the front end of HealthBoost because it provides a seamless user experience on both web and mobile devices. Additionally, React Native allows for easy customization of UI components, which is important for creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface.

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows for efficient server-side scripting. We are using Node.js to build the backend of the HealthBoost app because it provides a fast and scalable server-side environment. Node.js also allows for non-blocking I/O operations, making it ideal for handling a large volume of requests and data.

SQL: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing relational databases. We are using SQL to build the database for the HealthBoost app because it provides a reliable and efficient way to manage data. SQL databases are known for their scalability, security, and ease of use, which are all important factors for a health and wellness app that requires storing and managing sensitive user data.

RESTful API: REST (Representational State Transfer) is a standard architectural style for building web services. We are using RESTful API to communicate between the front end and back end of the HealthBoost app. RESTful API provides a lightweight and scalable way to transmit data between different components of the app. It also supports a wide range of programming languages and platforms, making it easy to integrate with other tools and services.

 The ER diagram also indicates the relationship between the tables:
- There’s a one-to-one relationship between the “create_acc” and “login” tables since an email can only be used to create one account and when logging in, both emails have to correlate. The “create_acc” and “login” tables also have a one-to-many relationship since each user can have several login attempts.
- There’s a one-to-many relationship between the “create_acc” and “userinfo” tables since one user account can be linked to multiple userinfo entries considering the app also tracks the users progress.

###### - Family Member :

Overall, they were generally impressed with the functionality of the app and felt that the main function of the app being the exercises with the timers were very useful when they used it. The main criticism that we got for the app was of how simplistic our UI design looked.

###### - Friends:

They were also impressed about the functionality of the app since this would be the first app that we have created. Their main highlight of the app is both the number of workouts available as well as the counter used to keep track of the calories lost, workouts completed, and time spent working out throughout the session. Their main criticism was the lack of profile customization and leaderboards; having these features would encourage and serve as motivation for their workout.
